# Time Complexity Analysis: Text File Processing in GoLang

## Unoptimized Code (Reading the file multiple times using different functions)

## Overview
This Go program processes a text file (`file.txt`) and performs various counting operations. It calculates the number of words, punctuation marks, vowels, sentences, paragraphs, and digits in the file. The program is structured with separate functions for each counting operation.

## Code Structure
- The main functionality is divided into several functions:
  - `countWords()`
  - `countPunctuation()`
  - `countVowels()`
  - `countSentences()`
  - `countParagraphs()`
  - `countDigits()`
- Helper functions are used to identify specific characters:
  - `isPunctuation()`
  - `isVowel()`
  - `isSentence()`
  - `isDigit()`
- The `main()` function orchestrates the execution of all counting operations and measures the total execution time.

## Performance Analysis
Based on the output provided:

1. **Execution Time**: The program completed all operations in 427.7591ms, which is relatively fast for processing a large text file.

2. **File Statistics**:
   - Words: 1,048,500
   - Punctuation marks: 115,305
   - Vowels: 2,416,411
   - Sentences: 62,714
   - Paragraphs: 10,485
   - Digits: 407,936

3. **Observations**:
   - The text contains a high number of words, indicating a substantial document.
   - There's a significant number of vowels, as expected in most languages.
   - The ratio of sentences to paragraphs (about 6:1) suggests relatively long paragraphs on average.
   - The presence of over 400,000 digits indicates that the text likely includes numerical data or references.

## Optimized Code (Reading the file once)

## Overview
The optimized version of the program uses a single function `optimizedCountAll()` to process the text file once, counting all the required elements simultaneously. This approach significantly reduces the number of file I/O operations and improves overall performance.

## Code Structure
- A single function `optimizedCountAll()` replaces the multiple counting functions from the unoptimized version.
- This function reads the file character by character and updates all counters in a single pass.
- The main() function now calls this optimized function and measures its execution time.

## Performance Analysis
Based on the output provided:

1. **Execution Time**: The optimized version completed all operations in 294.7336ms, which is a substantial improvement over the unoptimized version's 427.7591ms.

2. **File Statistics**:
   - Words: 1,048,500
   - Punctuation marks: 115,305
   - Vowels: 2,416,411
   - Sentences: 62,714
   - Paragraphs: 10,485
   - Digits: 407,936

3. **Observations**:
   - All statistics remain the same as in the unoptimized version, ensuring consistency in counting.
   - The optimized version maintains accuracy while significantly improving performance.

4. **Performance Improvement**:
   - The optimized code achieved a 31.10% improvement in execution time.
   - This significant speedup demonstrates the effectiveness of minimizing file I/O operations and processing the text in a single pass.

## Conclusion
The optimized version of the code demonstrates superior performance by reducing redundant file reads and combining all counting operations into a single pass through the text. This approach improves execution time without compromising accuracy. The trade-off between the slight increase in code complexity and the substantial performance gain makes this optimization highly beneficial for processing large text files.
